# üßæ Multi-language Invoice Extractor

## üíº Project Background

The **Multi-language Invoice Extractor** is a proof of concept (POC) that integrates **Google's Gemini Pro Model** and **Streamlit** to create an application capable of extracting and interpreting data from uploaded invoice images. This tool is designed for businesses operating in multiple countries where invoices are generated in various languages. 

The application leverages **Generative AI** to understand invoice details and respond to user queries based on the uploaded image, streamlining the process of invoice analysis for accounting, compliance, or auditing teams.
